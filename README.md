## 📖 Philosophy: Open Core

**Audiobook Toolkit** follows an **Open Core** philosophy:

- **Source Code is Free**: The full source code is available here under **GPL-3.0 with Commons Clause**. You are free to clone, modify, and build the application yourself.
- **Convenience is Paid**: To support development, we offer prebuilt installers and portable executables for a small fee on Gumroad.

**Every feature is available in the source code.** There are no features locked behind a paywall.

> **To install:** Click **"More info"** → **"Run anyway"**.
