**Title:** [Tool] Audiobook Toolkit - Open Source M4B Binder & Converter

**Link:** https://github.com/Zendevve/audiobook-toolkit

**Description:**
A modern, open-source desktop application to manage your audiobook collection. Perfect for fixing "folder of MP3s" downloads by binding them into a single M4B with proper chapters and metadata.

**Key Features for FMHY Users:**
*   📚 **MP3 to M4B**: Merge scattered audio files into a single, clean audiobook file.
*   ✂️ **Chapter Splitter**: Losslessly split large single-file audiobooks back into individual chapters.
*   🔄 **Format Converter**: Batch convert between M4B, MP3, FLAC, and M4A.
*   🕵️ **Privacy Focused**: Runs 100% offline. No accounts, no analytics, no spying.
*   🍎 **iTunes Fix**: One-click fix for "bookmarking broken" on older iPods/Apple Books.
*   🎨 **Modern GUI**: Clean dark-mode UI (no command line needed).

**Why add this?**
Many users download audiobooks as multi-part MP3s. This tool consolidates them into the superior M4B format with zero quality loss (stream copy supported). It is FOSS (GPL-3.0) and serves as a verified, privacy-friendly alternative to paid tools like AudioBookConverter.
